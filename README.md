# AnVILHCAR

Tools for working with exports from Human Cell Atlas Portal to NHGRI AnVIL

Our aim is to provide R functions that simplify operations with
HCA artifacts exported from the [project collection](https://explore.data.humancellatlas.org/projects).
As of 11 January 2026 an authenticated user can explore 526 projects.  This package
provides tools to work with "common elements" expected to be present in
exportable datasets associated with projects.

## Example user journey

Once you have authenticated, all projects are in view, and on the left
sidebar, filtering is supported.

If we select a single project, we have this view:

Drilling down, we find metadata in the right hand sidebar:
