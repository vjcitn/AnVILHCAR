# AnVILHCAR

Tools for working with exports from Human Cell Atlas Portal to NHGRI AnVIL

Our aim is to provide R functions that simplify operations with
HCA artifacts exported from the [project collection](https://explore.data.humancellatlas.org/projects).
As of 11 January 2026 an authenticated user can explore 526 projects.  This package
provides tools to work with "common elements" expected to be present in
exportable datasets associated with projects.
